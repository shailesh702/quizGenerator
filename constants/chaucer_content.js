Geoffrey Chaucer is regarded as the father of English literature. This is so because 
it is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that his work made to English 
literature was in popularizing the literary use of the vernacular, English, rather 
than French or Latin. English had, however, been used as a literary language for 
centuries before Chaucer‟s life, and several of Chaucer‟s contemporaries such as 
John Gower, William Langland, and the Pearl Poet also wrote major literary works 
in English. This unit therefore, examines Chaucer‟s major poem, The Canterbury 
Tales.

3.1 Chaucer’s Biography
Geoffrey Chaucer was born in London sometime around 1343, though the precise 
date and location of his birth remain unknown. His father and grandfather were 
both London vintners, several previous generations had been merchants in 
Ipswich. (His family name derives from the French “Chausseur” meaning 
“Shoemaker”). In 1324 John Chaucer, Geoffrey‟s father, was kidnapped by an 
aunt in the hope of marrying the twelve-year-old boy to her daughter so that she 
could keep the property in Ipswich. The aunt was imprisoned and the £250 fine 
levied suggests that the family was financially secure – bourgeois, if not elite.
John Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who, in 1349, inherited properties including 
24 shops in London from her uncle, Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will 
dated 3 April 1354 and listed in the city Hustings Roll as “Moneyer”; he was said 
to be moneyer at the Tower of London. In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, 
dated June 1380. 
Geoffrey Chaucer worked for Elizabeth de Burgh, the countess of Ulster as a 
courtier. He also worked as a diplomat and a civil servant. In 1359, in the early 
stages of the Hundred Years‟ War, Edward III invaded France and Chaucer 
travelled with Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, Elizabeth‟s husband, as 
part of the English army. In 1360, he was captured during the siege of Rheims. 
Edward paid £16 for his ransom, a considerable sum, and Chaucer was released. 
Around 1366, Chaucer married Phllipa (de) Roet. She was lady-in-waiting to 
Edward III‟s queen, Philippa of Hainaubt. 
Chaucer probably studied law in the Inner Temple in London. He became a 
member of the Royal court of Edward III as a variet de Chambre on 20 June, 1367, 
a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. He travelled abroad many 
times, at least some of them in his role as a varlet. Chaucer travelled to Picardy as 
part of a military expedition, and visited Genoa and Florence in 1373. Numerous 
scholars such as Skeat, Boitani, and Rowland suggested that, on this Italian trip, he 
came into contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio. They introduced him to medieval 
Italian poetry, the forms and stories of which he would use later. 
A widespread knowledge of Chaucer‟s works is attested to by the many poets who 
imitated or responded to his writing. John Lydgate was one of the earliest poets to 
write continuations of Chaucer‟s unfinished Tales while Robert Henryson‟s 
Testament of Cressied completed the story of Cressida left unfinished in his 
“Troilus and Criseyde”. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer‟s works contain 
material from these poets and later appreciations by the romantic era poets were 
shaped by their failure to distinguish the later “additions” from original Chaucer. 
Seventeenth and eighteenth century writers such as John Dryden admired Chaucer 
for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read 
Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers. It was not until the 
late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided 
upon, largely as a result of Walter William Skeat‟s work. 
Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer‟s death, the Canterbury Tales was 
selected by William Caxton to be one of the first books to be printed in England. 

3.2 Chaucer’s Poetry
Chaucer‟s poetry is different from the Anglo-Saxon poetry. Chaucer wrote in 
continental accentual-syllabic meter, a style which had developed around the 
twelfth century as an alternative to the alliterative Anglo-Saxon metre. Chaucer is 
known for his metrical innovation, inventing the rhyme royal, and being one of the 
first English poets to use the five-stress line, decasyllabic, in his work; only a few 
anonymous short works used it before him. 
The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming couplets, first seen in his 
“The Legend of Good Women”, was used in much of his later work and became 
one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also 
important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional 
dialect, apparently making its first appearance in “The Reeve‟s Tale”. Chaucer‟s 
poetry along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardize 
the London dialect of the Middle English language from a combination of the 
Kentish and Midlands dialects. This is probably overstated; the influence of the 
court, chancery and bureaucracy of which Chaucer was a part remains a more 
probable influence on the development of Standard English. Modern English is 
somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer‟s poems owing to the effect of 
the Great Vowel Shift some time after his death. This change in the pronunciation 
of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for 
the audience. The status of the final “-e” in Chaucer‟s verse is uncertain: it seems 
likely that during the period of Chaucer‟s writing the final “-e” was dropping out 
of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. Chaucer‟s 
versification suggests that the final “-e” is sometimes to be vocalized, and 
sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is 
disagreement. When it is vocalized, most scholars pronounce it as a schwa. Apart 
from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognizable to the modern 
reader. 

3.3 The Canterbury Tales
The Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories written in Middle English by 
Geoffrey Chaucer at the end of the 14th century. The tales are presented as part of 
a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey 
from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. 
The prize for this contest is a free meal at the Tabard Inn at Southwark on their return. 
The innovation of spring with which the General Prologue begins is lengthy and 
formal compared to the language of the rest of the prologue.
 When April the sweet showers fall
 And pierce the drought of March to the root, and all
 The veins are bathed in liquor of such power
 As brings about the engendering of the flower,
 When also Zephyrus with his sweet breath
 Exhales an air in every grove and heath
 Upon the tander shoots, and the young sun
 His half-course in the sign of the has run,
 And the small fowl are making melody
 That sleep sway the night with open eye
 (So nature pricks them and their heart engages)
 Then people long tto go on pilgrimages
 And palmers long to seek the stranger strands
 Of far-off saints, hallowed in sundry lands,
 And specially, from every shire‟s end
 Of England, down to Canterbury they wend
 To seek the holy blissful martyr, quick
 To give his help to them when they were sick
 (The Canterbury Tales)
The first lines situate the story in a particular time and place, but the speaker does 
this in cosmic and cyclical terms, celebrating the vitality and richness of spring. 
This approach gives the opening lines a dreamy, timeless, unspecified locality, and 
it is therefore surprising when the narrator reveals that he is going to describe a 
pilgrimage that he himself took rather than telling a love story. A pilgrimage is a 
religious journey undertaken for penance and grace. As pilgrimages went, 
Canterbury was not a very difficult destination for an English person to reach. It 
was, therefore, very popular in fourteenth–century England, as the narrator 
mentions. Pilgrims travelled to visit the remains of Saint Thomas Becket, 
archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered in 1170 by Knights of King Henry 
II. Soon after his death, he became the most popular saint in England. The 
pilgrimage in The Canterbury Tales should not be thought of as an entirely solemn 
occasion, because it also offered the pilgrims an opportunity to abandon work and 
take a vacation. 
In line 20, the narrator abandons his unspecified, all-knowing point of view, 
identifying himself as an actual person for the first time by inserting the first 
person “I” as he relates how he met the group of pilgrims while staying at the 
Tabard Inn. He emphasizes that this group, which he encountered by accident, was 
itself formed quite by chance (25-26). He then shifts into the first-person plural, 
referring to the pilgrims as “we” beginning in line 29, asserting his status as a 
member of the group. 
The narrator ends the introductory portion of his prologue by noting that he has 
“tyme and space” to tell his narrative. His comments underscore the fact that he is 
writing some time after the events of his story, and that he is describing the 
characters from memory. He has spoken and met with these people, but he has 
waited a certain length of time before sitting down and describing them. He seeks 
to describe each pilgrim as he or she seemed to him is also important, for it 
emphasizes that his descriptions are not only subject to his memory but are also 
shaped by his individual perceptions and opinions regarding each of the 
characters. He positions himself as a mediator between two groups: the group of 
pilgrims, of which he was a member, and us, the audience, whom the narrator 
explicitly addresses as “you” in lines 34 and 38. 
On the other hand, the narrator‟s declaration that he will tell us about the 
“condition”, “degree” and “array” (dress) of each of the pilgrims suggests that his 
portraits will be based on observed facts as well as his own opinions. He spends 
considerable time characterizing the group member according to their social 
positions. The pilgrims represent a diverse cross section of fourteenth – century 
English society. Medieval social theory divided society into three broad classes, 
called “estates”: the military, the clergy, and the laity. In the portraits that are seen 
in the rest of the “General Prologue”, the knight and squire represent the military 
estate. The clergy is represented by the prioress (and her nun and three priests), the 
Monk, the Frair, and the Parson. The other characters, from the wealthy Frankling 
to the poor Polyman, are the members of the laity. These lay characters can be 
further subdivided into landowners (the Franklin), professionals (the Clerk, the 
Man of the Law, the Guildsmen, the physician, and the shipman). Labourers (the 
cook and the Polyman), stewards (the Miller, the Manciple, and the Reeve), and 
church offers (the Summoner and the Pardoner). Chaucer‟s descriptions of the 
various characters and their social roles reveal the influence of the medieval genre 
of estates satire. 

3.4 Chaucer’s Style 
The variety of Chaucer‟s tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity 
with countless rhetorical forms and linguistic styles. Medieval schools of rhetoric 
at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature into high, middle, and 
low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another 
popular method of division came from St. Augustine, who focused more on 
audience response and less on subject matter. Augustine divided literature into 
“majestic persuades”, “temperature pleases”, and “subdued teaches”. Writers were 
encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, 
purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles. 
He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience but the other pilgrims 
within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. 
Chaucer‟s rises above medieval theories of style and rhetoric. 
It can be said that Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of 
readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with 
a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest 
characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their 
subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those 
of the higher classes refer to a woman as a “lady”, while the lower classes use the 
word “wenche”, with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely 
different things between classes. The word “pitee”, for example, is a noble concept 
to the upper classes, while in the “Merchant‟s Tales” it refers to sexual 
intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the Nun‟s Priest‟s Tale show surprising 
skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the “Knight‟s Tale” 
is at times extremely simple. 
Chaucer uses the same meter throughout in most of the tales, with the exception of 
“Sir Thomas” and his prose tales. It is a decasyllable line, probably borrowed from 
French and Italian forms, with riding rhyme and, occasionally, with a Caesura in 
the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 
15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of iambic pentameter. 

3.5 Themes of the Canterbury Tales
There are various themes in the work. The major themes are discussed below. 
Religion
The Tales reflect various views of the church in Chaucer‟s England. After the 
Black Death, many Europeans began to question the authority of the established 
church. Some turned to “lollardy”, while others chose less extreme paths, starting 
new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the 
behaviour of the clergy, false church relics or abuse of indulgences. Many of the 
characters in the tales are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage 
to Canterbury is religious making religion a significant theme of the work. Two 
characters, the pardoner and the summoner, whose roles apply the church‟s secular 
power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. A pardoner in 
Chaucer‟s days was a person from whom one bought Church “indulgences” for 
forgiveness of sins, but pardoners were often thought guilty of abusing their office 
for their own gain. Chaucer‟s pardoner openly admits the corruption of his 
practice while hawking his wares. The summoner is a church officer who brought 
sinners to the church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. 
Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing 
them in order to protect their interests. Chaucer‟s summoner is portrayed as guilty 
of the very kinds of sins he is threatening to bring others to court for, and is hinted 
as having a corruption relationship with the pardoner. 
Social Class and Convention
The upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the knight and his squire, was 
in Chaucer‟s time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were 
expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield, yet 
mannerly in the King‟s court and Christian in their actions. Knights were expected 
to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even 
stronger bond with a woman whom they idealized in order to strengthen their 
fighting ability. Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, often its 
conflicting values degenerated into violence. Church leaders often tried to place 
restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the 
loser. “The Knight‟s Tale” shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights 
turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealize, with both 
knights willing to fight the other to death in order to win her. Chivalry was in 
Chaucer‟s day on the decline, and it is possible that “The Knight‟s Tale” was 
intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed. Chaucer himself had fought 
in the Hundred Year‟s War under Edward III, who heavily emphasized chivalry 
during his reign. 
Relativism versus Realism 
Chaucer‟s characters each express different views of reality, creating an 
atmosphere of relativism. As Helen Cooper says: 
Different genres give different readings of the world: 
The fabliau scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint‟s 
life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and 
sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances 
privilege human emotion.
The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the Tales as a set unable 
to arrive at any definite truth or reality. 

4.0 CONCLUSION 
Geoffrey Chaucer has been recognized as the father of English literature. His 
works influenced the rest of other literary works which were written after him. He 
popularized the local English language and his works became accessible to many 
English people. This unit examines Chaucer and his poetry.
